RISC Zero Segfault Investigation - Key Findings
=====================================================

## Problem Summary
- Intermittent segfaults in RISC Zero circuit executor during witness generation
- Sometimes clean "Inconsistent set" panic, sometimes segfault during cleanup
- Occurs at FFI boundary between Rust and C++

## Root Cause Identified
**Location**: `emulators/risc0/risc0/circuit/rv32im-sys/kernels/cxx/buffers.h:33`
**Error**: `set(row: 1668, col: 14, val: 0x000001d5) cur: 0x000001d4`
- Circuit trying to write value `0x000001d5` to location that already has `0x000001d4`
- This throws C++ exception "Inconsistent set"

**CRITICAL INSIGHT - JALR LSB Issue**:
**Test case**: `misalign1-jalr-01.S` - specifically tests misaligned JALR instructions
**RISC-V spec**: JALR must clear LSB: `target = (rs1 + imm) & ~1`
**Bug**: Witness generation not properly handling LSB clearing in JALR implementation
**Evidence**: Values differ by exactly 1 bit: `0x000001d4` vs `0x000001d5` (LSB difference)

**DEEPER ISSUE - Duplicate Circuit Writes**:
**Problem**: Circuit witness generation is trying to write the SAME location twice with different values
**This indicates**: 
  - Bug in witness generation logic (should be deterministic)
  - Possible dual code paths computing same circuit position differently
  - May be preprocessing assumption vs actual execution mismatch
**Scenarios**:
  - JALR target computed twice: once assuming aligned, once with LSB clearing
  - Same instruction processed through multiple circuit paths
  - Constraint duplication in circuit design

**PRECISE CODE LOCATIONS**:
1. **Emulator (correct)**: `emulators/risc0/risc0/circuit/rv32im/src/execute/rv32im.rs:379`
   ```rust
   InsnKind::JalR => {
       new_pc = ByteAddr(rs1.wrapping_add(imm_i) & 0xfffffffe);  // ✓ LSB cleared
   ```

2. **Circuit (buggy)**: `emulators/risc0/risc0/circuit/rv32im/src/zirgen/steps.rs.inc:3892`
   ```rust
   new_pc: x35,  // x35 = rs1 + imm_i (NO LSB clearing)
   ```
   Where `x35` is computed as:
   ```rust
   let x35: DenormedValU32Struct = DenormedValU32Struct {
       low: (x34.low + x33.low),   // Raw addition, no masking
       high: (x34.high + x33.high),
   };
   ```

3. **PC Normalization**: `emulators/risc0/risc0/circuit/rv32im/src/zirgen/steps.rs.inc:2344`
   ```rust
   let x5: NormalizeU32Struct = exec_normalize_u32(ctx, &arg2.new_pc, ...);
   ```
   The normalization should handle LSB clearing but appears to be missing this logic.

**ROOT CAUSE**: Circuit generates raw `rs1 + imm_i` without LSB masking, then later normalization may apply LSB clearing, creating conflicting values at the same circuit location.

## Key Observations
1. **Two failure modes**:
   - Clean panic: Exception properly caught and converted to Rust error
   - Segfault: Double-free/cleanup issue during exception handling

2. **Timing dependency**: 
   - ~30% of runs segfault, ~70% clean panic
   - Valgrind masks the segfault (all runs become clean panics)
   - Suggests race condition during cleanup

3. **Multi-threading involved**: 
   - GDB shows 20+ threads created during execution
   - Threads exit during panic handling

## Technical Details
- **Error source**: C++ `Buffer::set()` method in witness generation
- **Values**: Trying to set `0x000001d5` over existing `0x000001d4` (difference of 1)
- **Location**: Always same row/col (1668, 14)
- **FFI wrapper**: `risc0_sys::ffi_wrap` converts C++ exceptions to Rust errors

## Community Impact of Segfault Issue
**Severity**: Medium-High reliability issue (potential memory safety implications)

**User Experience Impact**:
- **Inconsistent error reporting**: Users get either helpful error messages ("Inconsistent set") or cryptic segfaults for the same underlying issue
- **Difficult debugging**: Segfaults provide no useful diagnostic information vs clean panics with stack traces
- **Non-deterministic behavior**: Same test case fails differently on different runs (30% segfault, 70% clean panic)
- **CI/Testing problems**: Intermittent failures make automated testing unreliable

**Technical Impact**:
- **Root cause masking**: Segfaults hide the actual circuit logic error from developers
- **Investigation difficulty**: Race condition in multi-threaded cleanup makes the issue hard to reproduce consistently
- **Tool dependency**: Need Valgrind to get reliable error messages (performance penalty)

**Workarounds Available**:
- Run under Valgrind to force clean error messages (100% success rate for clean panics)
- Multiple test runs to eventually get clean panic with diagnostic info

**Memory Safety Concerns**: 
- **Likely memory corruption**: Circuit logic bug may be corrupting memory structures
- **Evidence**: Valgrind preventing segfaults suggests memory layout/tracking prevents corruption
- **Pattern**: Intermittent segfaults during cleanup indicate heap/stack corruption
- **Risk**: Potential for silent corruption in cases that don't immediately crash

## Status
- Successfully identified root cause in circuit logic (not memory corruption)
- Need to investigate why witness generation produces conflicting values
- Segfault is secondary issue from cleanup race condition 

## STATUS - IDENTIFIED EXACT FIX NEEDED

**EXACT FIX LOCATION**: `emulators/risc0/risc0/circuit/rv32im/src/zirgen/steps.rs.inc:3891`

**CURRENT BUGGY CODE**:
```rust
new_pc: x35,  // Line 3891 - uses raw addition result
```

**REQUIRED FIX**:
```rust
new_pc: DenormedValU32Struct {
    low: x35.low & Val::new(0xfffffffe),  // Clear LSB per RISC-V spec
    high: x35.high,
},
```

**Context**: This is in the JALR instruction branch within the `exec_misc2` function.

**Why this fixes it**: 
- x35 contains raw `rs1 + imm_i` without LSB clearing
- RISC-V spec requires JALR to clear LSB: `(rs1 + imm) & ~1`
- This prevents duplicate/conflicting values being written to same circuit location
- Eliminates \"Inconsistent set\" error and subsequent segfaults

**Testing**: After applying this fix, run the JALR misalignment test to verify no more \"Inconsistent set\" errors.

## Status
- Successfully identified root cause in circuit logic (not memory corruption)
- Need to investigate why witness generation produces conflicting values - COMPLETE ✓
- Segfault is secondary issue from cleanup race condition 
- EXACT FIX IDENTIFIED - Ready for implementation ✓ 

## VERSION COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS

**CRITICAL FINDINGS**:
1. **Zirgen separate repo**: Circuit source code is in https://github.com/risc0/zirgen (no releases)
2. **Recent constraint fix**: Commit `fb56c397` (Mar 19, 2025) mentions "companion of https://github.com/risc0/zirgen/pull/209"
3. **JALR bug predates fix**: Our bug is in `steps.rs.inc` which was NOT updated in the constraint fix
4. **Version tracking challenge**: No clear versioning between risc0 main repo and zirgen repo

**COMPATIBILITY RISKS**:
- Your commit may be using an older zirgen version with the JALR LSB bug
- Recent circuit updates exist but may not include JALR fix  
- Manual fix in generated code will be overwritten on rebuild

**IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND**: 
Since you successfully identified the exact fix needed, you can:
1. **Apply manual fix** to test if it resolves the issue
2. **Skip rebuilding** the circuit for now to preserve the fix  
3. **Report to RISC Zero** with specific details for upstream fix

**FOR LONG-TERM**: Report this as a RISC-V compliance bug in JALR implementation:
- Location: zirgen repo, inst_misc.zir OpJALR instruction  
- Issue: Missing LSB clearing per RISC-V spec requirement
- Impact: Causes circuit constraint conflicts and segfaults

## TESTING APPROACH

**Your manual fix is correct and should be tested**:
```rust
// In exec_misc2 around line 3891:
new_pc: DenormedValU32Struct {
    low: x35.low & Val::new(0xfffffffe),  // Clear LSB per RISC-V spec
    high: x35.high,
},
```

**Next steps**:
1. Fix any syntax errors in your manual edit
2. Test with `./compile_run.sh` to see if "Inconsistent set" errors disappear
3. If successful, report the bug with exact fix to RISC Zero team
